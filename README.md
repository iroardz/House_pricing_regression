# House_pricing_regression
This study aims to explore the relationship between specific variables and house prices. Additionally, we aim to develop a predictive model that can estimate house prices based on relevant characteristics.
 
During our exploratory analysis, we identified seven key variables associated with house prices:          
·	HouseAge    
·	PurchaseDate         
·	DistanceToStation    
·	NumConvenientStores  
·	Latitude             
·	Longitude            
 
Based on our statistical analysis, we’ve observed the following relationships among the variables:
1.	Distance to Station: There exists a negative relationship between the distance to the nearest station and the following variables:
a.	Number of Convenient Stores 
b.	Latitude
c.	Longitude
d.	House Price 
In other words, the house price tends to increase as the distance to the station decreases.
2.	Convenient Stores: A positive relationship exists between the number of convenience stores and the house price. When there are more convenient stores nearby, it tends to impact the house price positively.
